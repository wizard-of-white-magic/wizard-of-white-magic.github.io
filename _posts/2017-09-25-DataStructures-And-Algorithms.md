# Linked Lists
> Linked list is in a way strange datastructure, think of it as a one handed knight who is trying to save the world. There is no question of doubt as to whether linked lists have actually saved the world or not... You will understand it in a while. But for now, think of Linked List as Jaime Lannister (Any `GOT` fans reading this blog... ? No, Linked List has no sisters....)
> FYI, Jaime Lannister is a one handed knight in one of the TV series. If you dont know, dont worry, nothing related to Linked Lists. Just an analogy.


To actually understand linked list better or to appreciate linked lists better, we have to look at how Arrays were causing a problem in the first place.
