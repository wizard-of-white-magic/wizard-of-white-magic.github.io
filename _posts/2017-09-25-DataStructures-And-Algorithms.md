# Linked Lists
> Linked list is in a way a strange datastructure, think of it as a one handed knight who is trying to save the world. There is no question of doubt as to whether linked lists have actually saved the world or not... You will understand it in a while. 
> Below you would see `Spoiler Alert`'s , here I would try to explain a concept using some real world analogies or some tv series analogy.
> So, if you dont need spoilers you can skip it. I would use `Spoiler Alert` only if I'm using a Tv Series example :)
### Analogy: *(Spoiler Alert)*
> But for now, think of Linked List as Jaime Lannister (Any `GOT` fans reading this blog... ? No, Linked List has no sisters....)
> FYI, Jaime Lannister is a one handed knight in one of the TV series. If you dont know, dont worry, nothing related to Linked Lists.

I have just started off with the blog, pretty soon I'l be updating it on a weekly basis, or if I get the time, on a daily basis. So stay tuned....
